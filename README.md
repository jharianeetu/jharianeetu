## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 AI-ShortGPT
Built AI-ShortGPT, an AI-based pipeline to auto-generate YouTube Shorts using OpenAI GPT and Whisper Timestamped. Used yt-dlp, edge-tts, and MoviePy for audio extraction, voice synthesis, and video editing. Deployed with Gradio UI and managed data using TinyDB, tinymongo, and torch.

### 🔹 YouTube Channel Scraper
Developed a Streamlit app to scrape YouTube video metadata using yt-dlp, supporting channel, playlist, or user URLs. Parsed video title, view count, upload date, and duration; displayed in a DataFrame with CSV export. Implemented regex-based URL validation and used Pandas for data handling.

### 🔹 NLP-Based Entity & Sentiment Analyzer
Built an NLP-driven transcript analysis tool using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for entity extraction and sentiment classification. Applied prompt engineering to guide structured responses for names, places, projects, and overall sentiment. Utilized dotenv for secure API key management.

### 🔹 AI-Powered Invoice Parser
Designed an OCR-enabled invoice parser using Streamlit, converting PDF pages to images and extracting text via custom Tesseract-based pipelines. Applied OpenAI with prompt engineering to identify structured invoice fields. Performed text preprocessing, type conversion, and total computation with Pandas; enabled CSV export with an interactive UI.

### 🔹 Online Medical Store
Developed an “Online medical store” platform for browsing and ordering pharmaceutical products with integrated transaction handling. Built a backend using Spring Boot, MySQL, servlets, and DAO design pattern. Designed a responsive UI with JSP and CSS.

### 🔹 Facial Recognition Attendance System
Developed an AI-powered facial recognition attendance system using Haar Cascade, OpenCV, and deep learning. Integrated MySQL with a Tkinter GUI, used PIL for image handling, and managed data with CSV and OS modules. Includes a Python-based chatbot.

### 🔹 Optical Character Recognition
Built a web-based OCR system that extracts text in Hindi and English, reducing manual data entry by 60%. Deployed on AWS EC2 with Streamlit UI, using PyTesseract for extraction.

### 🔹 SMS Spam Classifier
Implemented an ML model to classify messages as spam or not, achieving over 90% accuracy. Used PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas to optimize data handling and feature extraction.

### 🔹 Currency Converter
Created a real-time currency converter in Java using Swing for GUI. Used JLabel, JComboBox, JTextField, and JButton components. Optimized with NetBeans IDE and JFrame layout.

### 🔹 IoT-Based Smart Health Monitoring System
Designed an IoT system to record heart rate and body temperature. Provided health suggestions using sensors, microcontrollers, and smart gateways.
